## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable programs, I focus on modular design, clear documentation, and following best practices like code commenting and adhering to consistent naming conventions. In particular, the CRUD Python module developed in Project One exemplifies this approach:

- Maintainable: The CRUD operations were encapsulated in a reusable class, making it easy to update and extend functionality without affecting other parts of the program. For instance, adding new database operations like pagination or more complex queries could be done within the module without modifying the dashboard.

- Readable: Proper naming conventions, comments, and the use of clear, descriptive function names ensured that the CRUD module was easy to understand, even for someone new to the project. I followed Pythonâ€™s PEP 8 guidelines for code readability.

- Adaptable: Since the CRUD module was abstracted to handle any MongoDB database or collection, it was adaptable to future projects. For example, in Project Two, I was able to seamlessly connect the dashboard widgets to MongoDB without needing to re-implement the database interaction logic. The advantage of this modular approach is that I can reuse the CRUD module in future projects that need database interaction, such as user management systems, e-commerce databases, or other dashboards requiring database connectivity.


## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I break it down into smaller, more manageable components. For the database and dashboard requirements of Grazioso Salvare, I first focused on understanding the data model (MongoDB), then built a clear interface for interacting with the database (CRUD module), and finally implemented the user interface with Dash.

This structured approach ensured that I could focus on one layer of the project at a time:
- Database layer: I built the CRUD functionality first, which allowed me to understand how data would be queried and manipulated.
- View layer: Once the data layer was complete, I focused on creating the dynamic dashboard widgets using Dash, ensuring that each part of the UI was properly linked to the database.

Compared to previous assignments, this project required more attention to integrating multiple technologies (Dash, MongoDB) and ensuring that the interface was dynamic and responsive. For future projects, I would likely adopt similar strategies, focusing on breaking down problems into data management, interface design, and user experience. When creating databases for other clients, I would emphasize data normalization, scalability, and security, ensuring the database can handle growth while maintaining efficiency.


## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists build and design systems that enable organizations to solve problems efficiently through automation, data management, and interactive interfaces. In this project for Grazioso Salvare, my work on the dashboard helps the company visualize and interact with their rescue operation data more effectively. By creating a system that allows the team to filter, view, and understand data at a glance, I helped streamline their workflows, allowing them to make more informed decisions about dog rescues.

This type of work matters because data-driven decision-making is crucial for organizations. The ability to interact with real-time data and derive actionable insights can lead to improved outcomes, whether it's in rescuing animals or optimizing business operations. For Grazioso Salvare, having a dashboard like this enables them to track, manage, and analyze rescue data more efficiently, ultimately improving the success rate of their rescue missions.
